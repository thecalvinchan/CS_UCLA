The solution takes the provided solution to the old homework assignment
and changes the implementation slightly. It uses continuations instead
of acceptor functions. In the original implementation, acceptor 
functions were passed in via input. In my implementation, I defined a 
custom acceptor function that calls the continuation on fragment if
successful.

By adding this acceptor, I defined a new make-matcher function
that uses the existing make-matcher function to determine whether or not
to call the redefined acceptor as a continuation.
